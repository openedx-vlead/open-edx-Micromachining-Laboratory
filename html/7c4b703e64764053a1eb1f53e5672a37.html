Electrolysis</b><br /><br /> Electrolysis is a chemical process, which occurs when an electric current is passed between two conductors (electrodes having different potentials) dipped into a liquid solution (electrolyte). The conductor connected to positive terminal is referred as anode and another connected to negative terminal is called as cathode. The system of electrodes and electrolyte is referred as electrolytic cell, whilst the chemical reactions, which occur at the electrodes, are called as the anodic or cathodic reactions.<br /> Electrolytes are different than metallic conductors of electricity, in that the current is carried not by electrons but by atoms (ions) or group of atoms.<br /> <b>For Example:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electrolysis of an Aqueous Copper Sulphate Solution using Copper Electrodes. The electrolysis of an aqueous solution of copper sulphate using copper electrodes (i.e. using active electrodes) results in transfer of copper metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis. The copper sulphate is ionized in aqueous solution.<br /> </span></p>

The reaction is completed when the anode is completely eaten away. This process is used in electroplating. Therefore in the electrolysis of copper sulphate, when the electrodes are weighted at the end of electrolysis, the anodic electrode will be found to have lost weight, whilst the cathodic electrode gains the weight by an amount equal to the lost by other electrode.<br /><br /> <b>Faraday's laws of electrolysis:</b><br /><br /> The results of electrolysis are embodied in Faraday&rsquo;s two laws of electrolysis as below<br /> 1. The amount of any substance dissolved or deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electricity which has flowed; and<br /> 2. The amounts of different substances deposited or dissolved by the same quantity of electricity are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights. <br /> The two laws may be combined to give the equation<br /><br /> </span></p>

These parameters are related to the current through Ohm&rsquo;s law, which states that the current I flowing in a conductor is directly proportional to the applied voltage V. <br /> </span></p>

Ohm&rsquo;s law also applies to this type of conductor, although the resistance of electrolytes may amount to hundreds of ohms. <br /> Now, the resistance R of a uniform conductor is directly proportional to its length h, and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area A.

If the conductor is a cube of side 10 mm, then R = &rho;; &rho; is termed as specific resistivity of the conductor. The reciprocal of specific resistivity is known as specific conductivity. Combining equations 2 and 3 the relationship are derived between the average current density, current, surface area to be machined, applied potential difference, gap width, and electrolyte conductivity being denoted by the respective symbols J, I, A, V, h, and ke <br /> </span></p>

A suitable electrolyte, for example aqueous sodium chloride solution is chosen so that the cathode shape remains unchanged during electrolysis. The electrolyte is pumped at a rate 3 to 30 m/sec through the gap between electrodes to remove the products of machining and to diminish unwanted effects, such as those that arise with cathodic gas generation and electric heating. The rate at which metal is then removed from the anode is approximately in inverse proportion to the distance between the electrodes. As machining proceeds, and with the simultaneous movement of the cathode at a typical rate, for example, 0.02 mm/sec towards the anode, the gap width along the electrode length will gradually tend to a steady-state value. Under these conditions, a shape, roughly complementary to that of cathode, will be produced on the anode. A typical gap width then should be about 0.4 mm.<br /><br /> </span></p>
