The test specimens prepared are of size 150 X 30mm.<br /><br /> </span></p>

The reason is to avoid the inconvenience of holding the sample in fixture before welding and during the shear tension test on an electronic tensometer.<br /> The samples are cleaned using acetone; an effective means for sample preparation for materials sensitive to residue and moisture. The lap joint is prepared with 30mm overlapping and holding in a fixture, which minimizes the air gap at the overlap. The fixture maintains the relative position of the weldments samples while providing beam access to the sample. The fixture should be adequately robust, and distortion should be avoided. The Figure 1.3 below shows a photograph of the sample mounted in fixture.<br /> <br /> </span></p>

Then specimens are polished by using different grades of polishing papers (1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, and 5/0) followed by lapping and polishing machine. After polishing the surface is thoroughly washed with soap solution and dried with a hot drier.<br /> For the purpose of metallographic analysis, the treated specimens were transversely cut on CNC Wire EDM. The samples are cold mounted and lapping process is completed. Subsequently the surface is etched, to observe the microstructure on Image Analyzer with microscope (shown in Figure 1.5), the recommended enchant Vilella&rsquo;s reagent (5cc HCL +100cc Ethanol + 1 gm picric acid) solution is used. This made the specimens ready for the study of microstructure as shown in Figure 1.4.<br /><br /> </span></p>

The case depth and width of the spot are measured by using image analyzer with microscope.<br /><br /> </span></p>

Therefore, to ensure the same successive polishing of the specimen is carried out to remove the minimum possible material.<br /><br /> <b>1.4 Weld strength tests</b><br /><br /> Sample used for Weld strength (tensile strength) test had the shape and dimensions as shown in Figure 1.7 above, the tensile strength is referred as weld strength in the next all chapters. The tensile strength test was carried out by using Electronic Tensometer Tester with a test speed of 0.2mm/min, experiment run, with a higher limit 2000N and minimum 20N.<br /><br /> </span></p>
