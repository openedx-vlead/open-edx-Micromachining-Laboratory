A suitable electrolyte, for example aqueous sodium chloride solution is chosen so that the cathode shape remains unchanged during electrolysis. The electrolyte is pumped at a rate 3 to 30 m/sec through the gap between electrodes to remove the products of machining and to diminish unwanted effects, such as those that arise with cathodic gas generation and electric heating. The rate at which metal is then removed from the anode is approximately in inverse proportion to the distance between the electrodes. As machining proceeds and with the simultaneous movement of the cathode at a typical tool feed rate, for example, 0.02 mm/sec towards the anode, the gap width along the electrode length will gradually tend to a steady-state value. Under these conditions, a shape, roughly complementary to that of cathode, will be produced on the anode. A typical gap width then should be about 0.4 mm.<br /><br /> </span></p>

Ohm's law and related concepts:- </b><br /><br /> The means by which high current densities are obtained can be understood from an examination of other characteristics of an ECM cell in particular, the electrolyte conductivity and inter-electrode gap width. These parameters are related to the current through Ohm&rsquo;s law, which states that the current I flowing in a conductor is directly proportional to the applied voltage V. <br /> </span></p>

Ohm&rsquo;s law also applies to this type of conductor, although the resistance of electrolytes may amount to hundreds of ohms. <br /> Now, the resistance R of a uniform conductor is directly proportional to its length h, and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area A.
