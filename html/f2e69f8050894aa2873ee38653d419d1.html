The experiment can be performed in three different modes viz. considering solid state heating, melting and evaporation.<br /> 2. One can determine heated volume in solid state, melt state and evaporation state (crater volume).<br /> 3. User needs to select the state as well as material.<br /> 4. A range of energy values is given and needs to be selected in order to perform the experiment.<br /> 5. After performing the experiment graph can be plotted in order to understand the response over a set of values <br /></span></p>
